/// \brief Manages staging buffers for efficient GPU transfers
/// \details Implements asynchronous GPU buffer uploads using staging buffers.
/// Staging buffers reside in CPU-visible memory and are copied to device-local
/// buffers via vkCmdCopyBuffer. This avoids stalling the GPU when uploading
/// large amounts of data. Supports frame-pipelined transfers for smooth rendering.
///
/// **Key Benefits:**
/// - Non-blocking uploads: CPU and GPU work in parallel
/// - Efficient large transfers: Staging buffer pool reduces allocations
/// - Frame pipelining: Multiple frames can have pending transfers
/// - Automatic cleanup: Fences track completion and free staging space
///
/// **Typical Usage:**
/// 1. Initialize(totalStagingSize) during Graphics setup
/// 2. RequestUpload(srcData, size, destBuffer) to queue a transfer
/// 3. Engine automatically submits pending transfers
/// 4. Staging space is freed when GPU signals fence completion
