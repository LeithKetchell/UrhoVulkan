## What's New in 2.0.1

### Vulkan Graphics Backend
- Full Vulkan rendering backend alongside legacy OpenGL and Direct3D 11
- All 55+ samples build and run on Vulkan
- GLSL to SPIR-V runtime shader compilation via glslang
- `URHO_VULKAN` shader define for Vulkan-specific shader paths (do not use `VULKAN` — conflicts with glslang)
- Native VkPipelineCache with on-disk persistence
- Shader module caching and redundant bind elimination
- Hybrid framebuffer support (swapchain color + custom depth RTT)
- RTT Y-flip fix — water reflections and render-to-texture samples render correctly
- Shadow mapping with projection-matrix depth bias
- TextureCube / skybox support
- Anisotropic filtering
- Render-to-texture infrastructure
- Per-frame profiler UI overlay (ProfilerUI) on all samples

### Rendering & Lighting
- **Hemisphere lighting** — two-color ambient (sky + ground) via Zone. One dot product, one mix. Defaults to existing flat ambient when ground color is zero
- FXAA anti-aliasing post-process
- Bloom post-process
- Motion blur post-process with camera-based reprojection (Sample 58)
- God rays post-process with 3-phase sun glow (pale white, vivid red at sunset, fade below horizon) and cool blue moon glow
- **Water droplets post-process** — 20 procedural droplets with gravity slide, teardrop shape, 6s dry time
- Custom shader uniform support (bare GLSL uniforms wrapped into constant buffer blocks)
- Selection outline system (silhouette mask + Sobel edge detection)
- Height fog with min/max height range, underwater inverse fog, and atmospheric time-of-day cycling
- Underwater color dynamically tracks zone fog color per frame
- Underwater sky darkens toward black with depth
- 4-layer terrain texture blending (4 detail layers from 3 texture fetches via alpha channel packing) with division-by-zero guard on empty weight maps
- Celestial body depth — sun and moon write depth (0.9999) so terrain occludes them correctly
- **GPU grass system** (in progress) — single-mesh, single draw call, 100K+ blades, VTF heightmap sampling, wind animation, distance fade

### Physics Enhancements
- Collision shapes integrated directly into RigidBody — no separate CollisionShape component required for common shapes (box, sphere, capsule, cylinder, cone, plane, trimesh, convex hull)
- Global primitive shape cache in PhysicsWorld — identical shapes shared across bodies (e.g. 500 boxes = 1 btBoxShape)
- Compound shape API on RigidBody (AddChildShape / ClearChildShapes) — compound children reference cached primitives
- Mesh/convex hull shape support (SetTriMeshShape, SetConvexHullShape)
- MultiBody component — btMultiBody integration for articulated rigid body chains
- Soft body physics via btSoftBody integration (Sample 59)
- Legacy CollisionShape component still supported for backward compatibility
- Rigid body activation events (E_RIGIDBODYSLEEP / E_RIGIDBODYWAKEUP)

### Particle System Enhancements
- Particle collision system — Kill, Bounce, and Stick modes for particles hitting surfaces
- Y-plane collision (fast, no physics dependency) and physics raycast collision (accurate)
- Decal spawning on particle impact — configurable material, size, and lifetime
- Full XML serialization — collision settings saved/loaded with particle effect files
- Zero cost when disabled, backward compatible

### Weather System
- **Cloud density sampling** from skybox alpha channel at camera position — cubemap face UV mapping with inverse cloud rotation
- **Lightning** — 2-5 flicker strikes with fade and pupil contraction effect
- Rain slider with density control
- Day/night cycle with seasonal variation (date/month/year sliders)

### Animal System
- **Animal base class** — LogicComponent with state machine (IDLE / WANDER / FLEE / DIE)
- Auto-scales model to target size using bounding box
- Terrain following, water avoidance, respawn, animation crossfade
- **Species**: Deer (3 anims), Fox (12 anims — attack, eating, death, gallop, walk, idle variants, hit reactions, jumps), Rabbit (11 anims)
- **SchoolFish** — flocking behaviour (cohesion, alignment, separation), 3 schools of 15, depth-dependent behaviour with dawn/dusk rising
- **Player swimming** — buoyancy, 3D swim with pitch+yaw, water drag, Space=up

### Survival Elements
- **Game database** — SQL-driven game rules: 16 tables, 85+ items, 50+ recipes, 9 creatures. Change the game with UPDATE, not recompilation
- Hunger, thirst, and survival pressure systems (in progress)
- Resource gathering and crafting pipeline designed around scarcity — extraction exceeds regeneration

### Networking & AuthServer
- **AuthServer** — central authority server for multiplayer terrain editing (port 9090, UDP via SLikeNet)
- **PAKE authentication** — Password-Authenticated Key Exchange using libsodium (X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- 4-message encrypted login flow with username enumeration prevention and forward secrecy
- **SQLite database** — user accounts and terrain patch ownership
- **Patch ownership** — grid-based territory system (128-unit patches), claim and query via protocol
- **Edit validation** — server validates terrain/object edits by patch ownership, broadcasts to all authenticated clients

## Tools

### ModelViewer
Standalone model inspection and repair tool (`build/bin/ModelViewer`).

- Load any .mdl file, auto-apply material lists, orbital camera with auto-framing
- **Mesh inspector**: per-geometry vertex/index counts, vertex element layout, LOD levels, bounding box dimensions
- **Skeleton inspector**: bone hierarchy with indentation, radius display, bone picking (click to highlight subtree)
- **Animation inspector**: track listing with channel masks (P/R/S), keyframe counts, time ranges, trigger points
- **Material inspector**: techniques, texture bindings by unit name, shader parameters, VS/PS defines
- **Morph target display** with current weights
- **Multi-animation blending**: per-layer weight sliders, Lerp/Add toggle, loop/reverse controls
- **Vertex Editor** (V key): select/move/delete vertices with ray-based picking, save edited model back to disk (Ctrl+S)
- **Bind pose display** from skeleton data, clickable bone list with detail popover

### AssetImporter
- **`info` command** — inspect native .mdl and .ani files without Assimp: geometry counts, bounding box dimensions, skeleton hierarchy, animation tracks with channel masks and keyframe ranges. Diagnoses scale problems — shows the bounding box diagonal and warns when a model is oversized, suggesting the correct `-scale` factor
- **`-normalize` flag** — auto-scale models to unit size by bounding box. Mutual exclusion with `-scale`
- **Assimp 6.0.4 upgrade** — embedded textures, PBR materials, multilayer texture support
- Bone scaling bug fixed — initialPosition, offsetMatrix, radius, and boundingBox now scale correctly
- Auto material list generation — multi-material models automatically get a .txt material list
- Strips CR/LF/CRLF from filenames and asset names

### WorkboardManager
GUI dashboard for coordinating multiple Claude Code instances (`build/bin/WorkboardManager`).

- Workboard display with Planned / In Progress / Done tables, plan browser with full markdown rendering
- **Multi-instance status dropdowns** — separate dropdowns for Coders (auto-numbered: coder, coder2, ...) and Unassigned instances, Planner singleton
- Bidirectional messaging with Claude Code instances via atomic message spool directories
- Message composer with per-role send buttons and broadcast
- Automatic liveness detection — crashed instances culled from status display
- LAN discovery beacon for multi-tool coordination
- Font/theme customization with persistent preferences
- Build with `-DURHO3D_TOOLS=1`

## FBX Pipeline

Urho3D's AssetImporter supports two FBX pathways using **incompatible FBX format versions**. Each pathway is one-directional.

### Import: External FBX to Urho
```
AssetImporter model input.fbx output.mdl [-scale 0.01]
```
- Reads **old FBX** (pre-7500) — the format used by Mixamo, Quaternius, and most asset stores
- Produces `.mdl` (model) and `.ani` (animation) files
- **Cannot** import FBX 7500 files

### Export: Urho to FBX (NEW — First External Format Export)
```
AssetImporter export input.mdl output.fbx [-anim path.ani ...] [-allanims] [-scale N]
```
This is the first time Urho3D can write its native data to any external file format. The engine has always been a one-way street — assets go in, nothing comes out. This changes that.

The exporter reads `.mdl` binary directly (no GPU required), reconstructs a full scene graph with geometry, skeleton, skin weights, and bone hierarchy, then writes FBX 7500 via Assimp's exporter. Optionally includes `.ani` animation files converted to FBX animation channels.

**What works:**
- Mesh geometry (vertices, normals, UVs, tangents, bitangents)
- Full skeleton hierarchy with bone transforms
- Skin weights and bone mappings (4 weights per vertex)
- Inverse bind pose matrices
- Animation tracks (position, rotation, scale keyframes) from `.ani` files
- Auto-discovery of matching `.ani` files with `-allanims`
- Scale correction for round-trip workflows

**What's not yet implemented:**
- Materials (exports placeholder names — models arrive grey in Blender)
- Textures (no texture path or embedded data in FBX output)
- PBR material properties (roughness, metallic)
- Morph targets / blend shapes
- LOD levels beyond LOD 0

**Status:** Underway. The hard part — skinned mesh with animation in a standard interchange format — is done. Material and texture export is next.

### Round-Trip Workflow
```
External Asset (Mixamo, etc.)
    | Old FBX
    v
AssetImporter import  -->  .mdl / .ani  -->  Urho3D
    |
    v FBX 7500 (AssetImporter export)
Blender (edit, add anims, rekey)
    |
    v Old FBX (Blender FBX export)
AssetImporter import  -->  .mdl / .ani  -->  Urho3D
```

Blender is the format bridge. You cannot skip Blender when going from FBX 7500 back to Urho.

### Import Scale
Artists are crap at making things to scale. Mixamo models are 100x too large. Always check:
```bash
AssetImporter info model.mdl    # shows bounding box diagonal
AssetImporter model input.fbx output.mdl -scale 0.01
```
FBX unit metadata is **not** honored by Assimp — you must use `-scale` manually.

### Model Formats
The engine reads three Urho model formats:
- **UMDL** (legacy bitmask) — use this for import (`-t` flag or default)
- **UMD2** (explicit vertex elements) — crashes on load in this build, avoid
- **UMD3** (header bounding box) — reverse-engineered, read-only support

## Editor (Sample 60 / TerrainNode)

A lightweight scene editor built as Sample 60 with multiplayer connectivity via AuthServer — LAN discovery, encrypted login, collaborative terrain/object editing with server-authoritative validation.

### Controls
- **WASD** to move, **mouse** to look (camera mode)
- **TAB** toggles camera mode / cursor mode (needed for menus and UI)
- **ESC** peels back UI layers one at a time
- **NumPad Enter** toggles all UI on/off

### Menu Bar
- **File**: Save/Load Scene, Import Model, Export Prefab, Exit
- **Create**: From Prefab (load XML as object brush), Clear Object Brush
- **Edit**: Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Y), Transform mode (Translate/Rotate/Scale), World/Local toggle
- **View**: Hierarchy window, Inspector window
- **Environment**: Terrain Tools, Time of Day slider (-12h to +12h)
- **Overlay**: Toggle Fullscreen (F11), Wireframe (Z), Debug Geometry (Space), Height Fog (H), Profiler

### Scene Hierarchy
Tree view of all nodes with expand/collapse. Nodes in white, components in green. Click to select, double-click to fly camera to node.

### Property Inspector
Editable attributes for the selected node — position, rotation, scale, component attributes. Floats, ints, strings, bools, enums, Vector3, Quaternion, Color — all editable inline. Changes apply immediately.

### Terrain Editing
- LMB = raise, RMB = lower
- Brush modes: Raise/Lower, Smooth, Flatten
- Brush shapes: circle, square, triangle, star, pentagon, hexagon, octagon
- Scroll wheel adjusts brush radius
- 32-bit heightmap precision (~4 billion height levels)
- Brush rotation slider with text input

### Day/Night Cycle
- Real-time sun/moon positioning synced to network time (Melbourne, AU)
- Date/Month/Year sliders for seasonal variation
- Cloud layer and star field rotate independently
- Height fog auto-scales with time of day
- God rays on sun and moon, reflected in water
- 1/2 keys track sun/moon with camera

### Prefab System
- Export selected node subtree as XML prefab
- Load prefab as object brush, click terrain to instance clones
- Clones orient to terrain surface normal
- Static clones settle via temporary physics then revert to zero-mass

### Underwater Fish — The Urho
The Urho is the official mascot of the Urho3D engine — a spiny, prehistoric-looking fish native to Finnish waters. 50 swim in the editor's ocean with reactive steering behaviours.

- CC0 fish model by Modanung (Urho3D community contributor) — first known UMD3 model loaded by the engine
- Vertex shader tail wiggle (FishWiggle.glsl) — sine wave displacement, adjustable via Environment menu
- Terrain-aware spawning, water column clamping
- Reactive steering: neighbour avoidance, wander, shallow water avoidance, boundary containment
- Camera interaction zones: orbit (3-15m), stare (<3m), veer-off (<1m)
- Depth-dependent behaviour — fish stay deep, rising at dawn/dusk with per-fish randomized schedule

### Minimap
Bottom-right corner, GPU-rendered orthographic RTT camera. Rotates with camera yaw, red dot shows position.

## Claude Code Multi-Instance Hooks

A complete IPC system for running multiple Claude Code instances on the same project as a coordinated team. Included as `ClaudeCodeTeamHooks.zip` in the project root.

- **Role-based coordination**: Planner (architecture/docs) + multiple Coders (implementation). First instance becomes Planner, subsequent instances become Coders
- **spawn-coder**: Launch new Coder instances from Planner — opens a real terminal, registers via SessionStart hook, receives initial prompt automatically
- **Build safety**: Per-target `flock` wrapper prevents concurrent `make` corruption when multiple Coders build simultaneously
- **File locking**: Atomic `mkdir`-based locks on Read/Write/Edit operations via PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks
- **Dead instance culling**: Stale PIDs detected and cleaned on startup and at runtime

See `.claude/INSTALL.md` inside the zip for setup instructions across Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL).

---

## IPC System (Message Spool V2)

Claude Code instances and the WorkboardManager communicate via atomic message files in spool directories. Messages cannot be lost — files persist until consumed.

```
/tmp/urho_claude/
    spool/
        to_coder/       # Messages waiting for Coder
        to_planner/     # Messages waiting for Planner
        to_manager/     # Messages waiting for Manager
    instances/          # PID/role registration
    wake_<role>         # FIFO for instant notification
```

Each message is an atomic file (`.tmp` -> rename to `.msg`) with headers and body. Sequence-numbered filenames guarantee ordering. See `Claude/IPC_PROTOCOL.md` for full details.

## Building

### Prerequisites (Linux)
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential libsdl2-dev libvulkan-dev \
    vulkan-tools vulkan-validationlayers-dev glslang-tools
```

## Vulkan Fixes
- Fullscreen toggle: RecreateSwapchainResources preserves device/textures/buffers
- Clear command: force EnsureRenderPassStarted when targets are dirty
- OnDeviceReset: proper reload for Texture2D, TextureCube, VertexBuffer, IndexBuffer
- Release null-safety for device/allocator teardown ordering
- **Pipeline cache validation** — vendor/device/UUID check, discards mismatched cache on load
- **Cubemap binding fallback** — separate 2D/Cube default textures prevent binding errors
- **Water surface depth bias** — eliminates white Z-fight line at terrain/water intersection

## Engine Changes
- AngelScript bindings for new RigidBody shape API and MultiBody
- Multi-viewport instancing fix for deferred GPU execution
- Vulkan screenshot capture (swapchain -> staging buffer -> BGRA->RGB -> PNG)
- Format string parsing fix in Str.cpp (flags, width, precision, length modifiers)
- Fixed upstream 1.9 bug in binding generator (`RemoveRefs` in `XmlAnalyzer.cpp`) — Doxygen XML nodes concatenated without whitespace, producing broken type declarations (~188 registrations affected)
- Animation text key infrastructure — AnimationTextKey, E_ANIMATIONTEXTKEY event, JSON sidecar loading. Fully wired, ready for tooling
- **Assimp 4.1.0 to 6.0.4 upgrade** — FBX 7500 export support, embedded textures, PBR material import

## Model Format
- UMD3 format support — reverse-engineered (bounding box at header, otherwise identical to UMD2)
- Oversized model rejection — `SetModel()` rejects models with bounding box exceeding 10 units unless `allowOversized = true`
- Engine reads all three Urho model formats: UMDL, UMD2, UMD3
