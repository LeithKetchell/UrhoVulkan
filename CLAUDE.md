# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Urho3D** is a free, lightweight, cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine implemented in C++, released under the MIT license. It supports multiple scripting languages (AngelScript, Lua) and multiple rendering backends (OpenGL, Direct3D 11).

- **Current Version**: 2.0.1
- **Build System**: CMake 3.15+
- **Supported Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, tvOS, Android, Web (Emscripten), Raspberry Pi
- **Documentation**: https://urho3d.io/documentation
- **Contributing**: https://urho3d.io/documentation/HEAD/_contribution_checklist.html

## Session Startup Protocol

Claude Code instances in this project coordinate via IPC hooks and a WorkboardManager GUI. See `Claude/IPC_PROTOCOL.md` for internal details.

On session start:

1. You are auto-registered on startup
2. Check `/tmp/urho_claude/instances/*.pid` — if no `planner.pid` exists, the first instance assumes **Planner**. Subsequent instances assume **Coder**.
3. **Stale PID check:** If `planner.pid` exists but the PID inside it is dead (`ps -p <PID>` fails), remove the stale file (`rm /tmp/urho_claude/instances/planner.pid`) and assume Planner. Same applies to any role PID file — verify the process is alive before treating it as taken.
4. Announce your role to the Manager: `.claude/hooks/claude_ipc.sh assume <role>`
5. Read the workboard: `Claude/WORKBOARD.md`
6. Start listening for messages
7. The Manager can reach you between prompts — react to incoming messages and keep listening

### Spawning Coders

**NEVER use the Task tool to spawn coder instances.** Task subagents are API calls inside your process — they cannot run Bash, cannot register with IPC, and are not real processes.

To spawn a new Coder instance, use the dedicated command:

```bash
.claude/hooks/claude_ipc.sh spawn-coder
```

This opens a real terminal with its own `claude` process, own PID, own TTY, and own permissions. The new instance self-registers via the SessionStart hook, and Planner queues a role assignment message for it.

## Build Commands

### Quick Start (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Configure CMake build
script/cmake_generic.sh build

# Build the project
cd build
make -j$(nproc)
```

### Using Rake (Recommended)

The `rakefile` provides high-level build tasks:

```bash
# Configure and build
rake build

# Build with specific options
rake build URHO3D_ANGELSCRIPT=1 URHO3D_LUA=1 URHO3D_PHYSICS=1

# Release build
rake build CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Run tests
rake test

# Generate documentation
rake doc

# Clean build artifacts
rake clean
```

### Cross-Compilation

```bash
# Raspberry Pi / ARM
script/cmake_rpi.sh build

# Web (Emscripten)
script/cmake_emscripten.sh build

# iOS
script/cmake_ios.sh build

# Android (uses Gradle)
rake build PLATFORM=android

# MinGW (Windows)
script/cmake_mingw.sh build
```

### Build Configuration Options

Key CMake options are stored in `script/.build-options`. Common ones:

```bash
-DURHO3D_ANGELSCRIPT=1          # Enable AngelScript support
-DURHO3D_LUA=1                  # Enable Lua support
-DURHO3D_PHYSICS=1              # Enable Bullet physics
-DURHO3D_PHYSICS2D=1            # Enable Box2D physics
-DURHO3D_NAVIGATION=1           # Enable pathfinding (Recast/Detour)
-DURHO3D_URHO2D=1               # Enable 2D engine
-DURHO3D_NETWORK=1              # Enable networking
-DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1              # Build example projects
-DURHO3D_TOOLS=1                # Build development tools
-DURHO3D_TESTING=1              # Enable tests
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release      # Release vs Debug
-DURHO3D_LIB_TYPE=SHARED        # Shared library (default: STATIC)
```

## Multi-Coder Build Safety

When multiple Claude Code instances (coders) are working simultaneously, **never use raw `make` directly**. Use the safe build wrapper:

```bash
# ALWAYS use this instead of raw make:
.claude/hooks/safe_build.sh <TargetName>

# Examples:
.claude/hooks/safe_build.sh 60_TerrainNode
.claude/hooks/safe_build.sh WorkboardManager
.claude/hooks/safe_build.sh AuthServer
```

This acquires a per-target `flock` before running `make -j4`. If another coder is building the same target, the second coder blocks until the first finishes, then benefits from the freshly built artifacts.

**File I/O locking** is handled automatically via PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks on Read/Write/Edit operations. No manual action needed — the hooks use atomic `mkdir`-based locks to prevent concurrent file access races.

If locks get stuck, use the **Clear File Locks** button in WorkboardManager, or manually: `rm -rf /tmp/urho_claude/locks/*`

**Planner role restriction:** Planner must NEVER run `make`, `safe_build.sh`, or any build/compile commands. Planner must NEVER accept coding tasks — no writing C++, no editing shaders, no modifying engine source. Planner writes plans, docs, and research. If Leith asks Planner to do coding work, Planner must **deny the request** and remind him: "I'm Planner, not Coder. Coding tasks go to a Coder instance. This separation exists to prevent build conflicts and role confusion."

**Exception:** When no Manager is running (Coders are effectively offline without it) **or** no Coders are registered, Planner may temporarily perform all coding and build tasks. Once a Manager is live **and** at least one Coder is registered, Planner returns to plans/docs only.

**Workboard hygiene — MANDATORY for ALL roles (Planner, Coder, everyone):**

1. **Claim a task → run `wb-assign` BEFORE doing anything else.** This atomically moves the task from Planned to In Progress, sets the owner, and notifies via TTY. No manual moves, no "I'll update it later." If `wb-assign` doesn't exist for your situation (e.g., self-assigning under the exception rule), use `wb-add-inprogress` + `wb-remove` from Planned. Either way: **workboard updated BEFORE the first line of work. Non-negotiable.**
2. **Complete ALL phases of a task → IMMEDIATELY move it from In Progress to Done.** A task is not done until every phase in its plan is finished. When it is, move it right then — not later, not after the next task.
3. **No duplicates.** Moving a task means removing it from the old table and adding it to the new one. Never leave stale entries behind.
4. **No orphans.** Every task you're working on must be visible In Progress. Every task you've finished must be visible in Done. Nothing dangling in Ready/Planned that you've already started or completed.
5. **Review status.** When you finish, mark your own Review column as `Pending` so Planner can review.

Failure to follow these rules creates confusion about what's being worked on, causes duplicate work, and wastes everyone's time. This is not optional.

**Task assignment protocol — MANDATORY for ALL roles:**

When assigning or claiming tasks, **ALWAYS use `wb-assign`** (or `wb-add-inprogress` + `wb-remove` when self-assigning). This applies to Planner, Coders, everyone — no exceptions.

1. Use `wb-assign <task-name> <role>` — atomic claim + TTY notify
2. NEVER send a task via TTY without updating the workboard FIRST
3. NEVER broadcast a task to multiple Coders — assign to ONE, notify ONE
4. Planner under the exception rule (no Manager/no Coders) must STILL update the workboard before starting work

Sending tasks via TTY without workboard mediation caused a race condition (Mar 29, 2026) where two Coders worked the same task simultaneously. File locks prevented data corruption but the duplicate work was entirely avoidable. Planner also failed to move a completed task to Done (Scene tab removal, same day). These failures are preventable — use the tools.

**Pipeline cache after shader edits:** When a local Coder modifies any GLSL shader file and rebuilds Sample 60, they MUST delete `~/.local/share/urho3d/pipeline_cache.bin` after the build completes. Stale pipeline cache entries will serve old shader bytecode — deleting it ensures the next run recompiles all shaders fresh.

## Core Architecture

### Engine Modules

The engine is divided into 24 specialized modules in `/Source/Urho3D/`:

**Foundation**: Core, Container, Math (event system, data structures, math)
**Engine**: Engine, IO, Resource, Scene (application lifecycle, resource management, scene graph)
**Graphics**: Graphics, GraphicsAPI, UI (rendering pipeline, materials, UI components)
**Specialized**: Input, Audio, Physics, Physics2D, Navigation, Urho2D, IK, Network, Database
**Scripting**: AngelScript, LuaScript (2.35.1 and Lua/LuaJIT bindings)

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Event System**: Core event-driven architecture via `Object` and `Context` classes
2. **Component Architecture**: Node/Component pattern for scene graph (`Node`, `Component`, `LogicComponent`)
3. **Resource Management**: Centralized `ResourceCache` for asset loading and caching
4. **Module Layering**: Foundation → Engine → Subsystems → Application
5. **Serialization**: XML-based scene/component serialization via pugixml

### Important Files

Each sample is a standalone CMake project. Build all samples with:

```bash
rake build URHO3D_SAMPLES=1
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Locate the relevant module**: Code changes typically belong in one of the 24 modules in `/Source/Urho3D/`
2. **Check examples**: Review `/Source/Samples/` for examples demonstrating similar features
3. **Build and test**: Use `rake build` and `rake test` for validation
4. **Follow conventions**: Use clang-format and clang-tidy for code quality
5. **Test on platforms**: Use cross-compilation scripts for multi-platform validation

## Vulkan Graphics Backend (NEW)

### Overview

Urho3D 2.0.1 now includes **Vulkan** as a modern graphics backend alongside legacy OpenGL and Direct3D 11 support. Vulkan is available on:

- **Linux/Windows**: Native Vulkan support
- **macOS/iOS/tvOS**: Via MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal translation layer)
- **Android**: Native Vulkan support (API 24+)

The engine automatically selects the best available backend with fallback to OpenGL/D3D11 on platforms where Vulkan is unavailable.

### Building with Vulkan

```bash
# Configure with Vulkan backend (Linux)
script/cmake_generic.sh build -DURHO3D_VULKAN=1

# Build with samples
script/cmake_generic.sh build -DURHO3D_VULKAN=1 -DURHO3D_SAMPLES=1

# Or using Rake
rake build URHO3D_VULKAN=1 URHO3D_SAMPLES=1
```

### Graphics API Priority

The engine automatically selects the best available graphics backend in this order:

1. **Vulkan** (if available and `-DURHO3D_VULKAN=1` enabled)
2. **OpenGL** (Linux/macOS default, always available)
3. **Direct3D 11** (Windows fallback)

Only one backend can be enabled per build for safety and clarity.

- Complete integration roadmap documented

#### Architecture Patterns

**Dispatch Pattern**: All Graphics methods use runtime dispatch:
```cpp
void Graphics::SetTexture(unsigned index, Texture* texture) {
    if (gapi == GAPI_VULKAN)
        return SetTexture_Vulkan(index, texture);
    else if (gapi == GAPI_OPENGL)
        return SetTexture_OGL(index, texture);
    // ... etc
}
```

**State Caching**: Pipelines and samplers are cached by hash for performance.

**Frame Pipelining**: Triple-buffering ensures GPU and CPU don't stall:
- Frame 0: GPU renders while CPU prepares frame 1
- Frame 1: GPU renders while CPU prepares frame 2
- Frame 2: GPU renders while CPU prepares frame 0

### Current Implementation Status

**Phases Complete:**
- ✅ Phase 1: CMake integration with Vulkan SDK detection
- ✅ Phase 2: API abstraction layer (GAPI_VULKAN enum)
- ✅ Phase 3: Core graphics initialization and frame lifecycle
- ✅ Phase 4: Vertex/Index buffers with VMA allocation
- ✅ Phase 5: Texture loading with sampler management
- ✅ Phase 6: Shader compilation with shaderc/glslang fallback
- ✅ Phase 7: SPIR-V reflection and descriptor pool management
- ✅ Phase 8: Graphics pipeline creation and binding
- ✅ Phase 9: Constant buffers and shader parameters (framework complete)
- ✅ Phase 30: MSAA color image support and depth buffer management
- ✅ Phase 31: G-Buffer attachment creation (4 color + shared depth for deferred rendering)
- ✅ Phase 32: GPU state application - Graphics state to pipeline state conversion
- ✅ Phase 33: Shader module integration - Vertex/fragment shader compilation and binding
- ✅ Phase 34: Deferred Rendering Framework (render target binding, G-Buffer lifecycle, framebuffer selection)
- ✅ Phase 35: Extended Render Pass Descriptor (multi-attachment, multi-subpass support)

**Phases In Progress:**
- 🔄 Phase 36+: Advanced deferred rendering features (geometry shaders, compute, lighting passes)

**Supported Platforms:**
- ✅ Linux (X11/Wayland) - Native Vulkan
- ✅ Windows (Win32) - Native Vulkan
- ✅ macOS - MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal translation)
- ✅ iOS - MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal translation)
- ✅ tvOS - MoltenVK (Vulkan → Metal translation)
- ✅ Android - Native Vulkan (API 24+)

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Full material parameter reflection
- Deferred lighting pass implementation
- Input attachments for lighting
- Instancing optimization

### Known Limitations (v2.0)

- **Texture descriptor sets not yet bound**: `SetTexture_Vulkan()` stores texture pointers but doesn't create/bind Vulkan descriptor sets. Only solid color rendering works (logo), text rendering fails (requires font atlas texture)
- Deferred rendering framework complete, lighting pass not yet implemented
- MSAA support framework exists, full integration pending
- No compute shader support yet
- Full shader parameter reflection not yet implemented
- No timeline semaphore support
- Staging buffers not yet optimized (optional Phase 10)
- Input attachments for deferred lighting not yet bound in draw calls

### Debugging with Vulkan

#### Enable Validation

```bash
export VK_LAYER_PATH=/path/to/vulkan-sdk/lib
export VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation
./your_app
```

#### Common Issues

1. **"No Vulkan-capable devices found"**
   - Install Vulkan drivers for your GPU
   - Check NVIDIA/AMD driver versions

2. **"Failed to create swapchain"**
   - Window may not support presentation
   - Try running in windowed mode

3. **"Failed to compile shader"**
   - Ensure glslang or shaderc is installed
   - Check shader source for syntax errors

### Building with MoltenVK (macOS/iOS/tvOS)

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# macOS: Install MoltenVK via Homebrew
brew install molten-vk

# Or download Vulkan SDK for macOS from:
# https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac
```

**Building for macOS:**
```bash
# Configure with Vulkan/MoltenVK support
script/cmake_generic.sh build -DURHO3D_VULKAN=1

# Build
cd build && make -j$(nproc)
```

**Building for iOS:**
```bash
# Configure iOS build with Vulkan/MoltenVK
script/cmake_ios.sh build-ios -DURHO3D_VULKAN=1

# Build
cd build-ios && make -j$(nproc)
```

**MoltenVK Limitations:**
- No geometry shaders (not supported by Metal)
- Limited tessellation support
- Some Vulkan 1.1+ features unavailable
- Compute shader support varies by device
- Best results with forward rendering paths

### Building for Android with Vulkan

**Prerequisites:**
- Android NDK with API level 24+ support
- Vulkan is natively supported (no additional libraries needed)

**Building:**
```bash
# Configure Android build with Vulkan
rake build PLATFORM=android URHO3D_VULKAN=1

# Or manually with Gradle
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease -PANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -PURHO3D_VULKAN=1
```

**Android Manifest Requirements:**
Your AndroidManifest.xml should include:
```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.vulkan.version"
              android:version="0x400003"
              android:required="false"/>
<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="24"/>
```

**Testing Android Vulkan:**
- Not all Android devices support Vulkan (check device specs)
- Vulkan drivers vary in quality across vendors
- Test on multiple devices (Qualcomm Adreno, ARM Mali, etc.)
- Use validation layers during development

### Future Enhancements

- Compute shader support
- Advanced descriptor management
- Timeline semaphore support
- Deferred rendering optimization
- Ray tracing support (desktop only)

- [Vulkan Specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/)
- [Vulkan Samples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples)
- [VMA Documentation](https://gpuopen.com/vulkan-memory-allocator/)

## ProfilerUI in Examples (STANDARD PATTERN)

All 55+ examples now follow a consistent pattern for displaying the Vulkan profiler UI overlay with proper styling.

### Required Setup in Example Headers (.h)

```cpp
#pragma once

#include "Sample.h"
#include <Urho3D/Graphics/ProfilerUI.h>

class YourExample : public Sample
{
    // ... class definition ...

private:
    /// Profiler UI overlay
    SharedPtr<ProfilerUI> profilerUI_;
};
```

### Required Setup in Start() Method

```cpp
void YourExample::Start()
{
    // Execute base class startup
    Sample::Start();

    // Load UI style for ProfilerUI (must be before creating UI elements)
    auto* cache = GetSubsystem<ResourceCache>();
    auto* uiStyle = cache->GetResource<XMLFile>("UI/DefaultStyle.xml");
    GetSubsystem<UI>()->GetRoot()->SetDefaultStyle(uiStyle);

    // ... create scene, UI, setup viewport, subscribe to events ...

    // Set the mouse mode to use in the sample
    Sample::InitMouseMode(MM_FREE);

    // Initialize profiler UI
    auto* graphics = GetSubsystem<Graphics>();
    auto* ui = GetSubsystem<UI>();
    profilerUI_ = new ProfilerUI(context_);
    profilerUI_->Initialize(ui, graphics->GetVulkanProfiler());
    profilerUI_->SetVisible(true);
}
```

### Required Setup in HandleUpdate() Method

```cpp
void YourExample::HandleUpdate(StringHash eventType, VariantMap& eventData)
{
    using namespace Update;
    float timeStep = eventData[P_TIMESTEP].GetFloat();

    // ... your update code ...

    // Update profiler display
    if (profilerUI_)
    {
        GetSubsystem<Graphics>()->GetVulkanProfiler()->RecordFrame(timeStep);
        profilerUI_->Update();
    }
}
```

### Key Points

1. **UI style must be loaded FIRST** - before any UI element creation
2. **ProfilerUI must be initialized LAST** - after InitMouseMode() and all other setup
3. **HandleUpdate must call both RecordFrame() and Update()** - to properly display metrics
4. **All examples use the same pattern** - ensures consistency across the codebase

### Current Status

✅ **All 55 numbered examples + benchmark properly configured**
✅ **Complete build verification successful**
✅ **See EXAMPLES_UI_FIXES_SUMMARY.md for detailed changes**

## Deferred Rendering (Phase 36 - ✅ CORE COMPLETE)

### Overview

Urho3D's deferred rendering system is fully implemented and working on OpenGL and Direct3D 11. The system uses a two-pass approach:

1. **G-Buffer Pass**: Geometry is rendered to multiple render targets (position, normal, albedo, specular)
2. **Lighting Pass**: Light volumes are rendered, reading from G-Buffer textures to compute lighting

**Vulkan Status:** ✅ Core implementation complete, ready for end-to-end testing

### Architecture

**Complete Flow (OpenGL/D3D11 - Reference Implementation)**:
1. `View::Define()` - Detects `CMD_LIGHTVOLUMES` in render path, sets `deferred_ = true`
2. `View::GetLightBatches()` - Creates light volume batches with appropriate geometry (sphere/cone/quad)
3. `Renderer::SetLightVolumeBatchShaders()` - Selects shader variations based on light type, shadows, etc.
4. `View::ExecuteRenderPathCommands()` - Executes lighting pass:
   - Binds G-Buffer textures as shader inputs
   - Sets up graphics state (additive blend, depth test, stencil)
   - Renders light volume geometry
5. `DeferredLight.glsl` - Shader reads G-Buffer, computes lighting, outputs to framebuffer

**Key Components**:
- **Light Geometries**: Fullscreen quad (directional), sphere (point), cone (spot)
- **Shader Variations**: 64 pixel shader variants for different light types/features
- **Stencil Optimization**: Mark-to-stencil prevents redundant lighting calculations
- **State Management**: Custom depth test (CMP_GREATER inside light volume, CMP_LESSEQUAL outside)

### Vulkan Implementation Status (Phase 36)

**✅ Completed Infrastructure** (December 2024):
- ✅ G-Buffer creation (4 attachments: position, normal, albedo, specular)
- ✅ Render pass framework with multi-subpass support
- ✅ Full-screen quad geometry for lighting pass
- ✅ Shader compilation (GLSL → SPIR-V)
- ✅ Graphics pipeline creation and binding
- ✅ State management (blend, depth, stencil, cull)
- ✅ Render target switching
- ✅ Material descriptor binding

**✅ Phase 36 Complete Features**:
- ✅ SetTexture_Vulkan() - Stores G-Buffer textures for descriptor binding
- ✅ SetShaderParameter_Vulkan() - Batches shader parameters for upload
- ✅ CalculateParameterBufferSize() - Computes std140 buffer layout
- ✅ PackShaderParameters() - Packs parameters with std140 alignment
- ✅ UploadPendingShaderParameters_Vulkan() - Uploads constant buffers to GPU
- ✅ CreateConstantBufferDescriptorSet_Vulkan() - Creates descriptor sets
- ✅ BindConstantBufferDescriptors_Vulkan() - Binds descriptors to pipeline
- ✅ Multi-set pipeline layouts - 4 sets: materials, textures, constants, input attachments
- ✅ VulkanConstantBufferPool integration - Efficient GPU memory allocation
- ✅ Full build verification - All 55+ samples compile successfully

**⏳ Pending Testing**:
1. **End-to-End Runtime Testing**:
   - Run `56_DeferredRendering` sample with Vulkan backend
   - Verify G-Buffer pass + lighting pass execute correctly
   - Test with multiple light types (point, spot, directional)
   - Validate with Vulkan validation layers

2. **Performance Profiling**:
   - Compare frame times vs. OpenGL backend
   - Profile descriptor set allocations with RenderDoc
   - Measure constant buffer upload overhead

**⚠️ Future Optimizations** (Phase 37+):
- Descriptor set caching (avoid reallocations per frame)
- Dynamic descriptor sets with buffer offsets
- Parameter change tracking (skip unchanged uploads)
- Push constants for small parameters (<128 bytes)

### Testing Deferred Rendering

Once implementation is complete, test with:

```bash
# Run sample with deferred render path
./01_HelloWorld -renderpath RenderPaths/Deferred.xml

# Enable profiling
./01_HelloWorld -renderpath RenderPaths/Deferred.xml -profile
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- G-Buffer pass renders geometry to 4 render targets
- Lighting pass composites lights using light volume geometry
- Final output shows fully lit scene with shadows (if enabled)
- ProfilerUI shows G-Buffer pass + lighting pass timings

## Vulkan Backend Selection (December 2025)

### Status: ✅ Infrastructure Complete, Constructor Implementation Pending

The Vulkan backend can now be selected at runtime. When built with `-DURHO3D_VULKAN=1`, Vulkan becomes the default graphics API.

### Changes Implemented

1. **Engine Parameter** (`EngineDefs.h:18`):
   ```cpp
   static const String EP_VULKAN = "Vulkan";
   ```

2. **Engine Initialization** (`Engine.cpp:175-177, 193-197`):
   - Vulkan set as default GAPI when `URHO3D_VULKAN=1`
   - Command-line override: `-Vulkan=true` or `-OpenGL=true`

3. **Graphics Constructor Dispatch** (`Graphics.cpp:607-613`):
   - `Constructor_Vulkan()` called when `gapi == GAPI_VULKAN`

### Usage

```bash
# Vulkan is default when URHO3D_VULKAN=1
./your_app

# Force OpenGL even when Vulkan is available
./your_app -OpenGL=true

# Explicitly request Vulkan
./your_app -Vulkan=true
```

### Remaining Work

**Constructor_Vulkan() Implementation** (`Graphics_Vulkan.cpp:27-30`):
- Currently a stub that only logs a message
- Needs to initialize VulkanGraphicsImpl, SDL window, and Vulkan instance
- See `VULKAN_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` for detailed implementation plan

### Documentation

- Full details: `/VULKAN_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`
- Phase 36 status: `/PHASE_36_STATUS.md`

## Known Build Options and Platforms

- **32/64-bit**: `-DURHO3D_64BIT=1` (default: auto-detect)
- **Graphics API**: `-DURHO3D_VULKAN=1` (Linux/Windows, new), `-DURHO3D_OPENGL=1` (Linux/macOS default), or `-DURHO3D_D3D11=1` (Windows)
- **CPU Features**: `-DURHO3D_SSE=1`, `-DURHO3D_MMX=1`, `-DURHO3D_3DNOW=1`
- **Android**: Uses Gradle build system (separate from CMake)
- never revert to urho3d 1.9 github - this is not the same animal
- always ask before assuming old code is bad code
- in future, you have access to older working code, compare them
- older code can be found one folder up, check the datestamps, use the most recent one as a reference
- older code is stored in zip format
- before removing or replacing any code, enumerate what it does and what will be lost — even when explicitly told to remove it. Raise objections if the code has functional value that may have been overlooked. Be objective, not eager to please.
- all new .md and .csv files will be stored in the Claude folder
- URHO3D_GLSLANG flag must be specified to build urho3d lib when vulkan backend is specified, otherwise no support for glsl to spirv runtime compilation
- Always use Urho3D engine functionality where possible (FileSystem, File, Log, ResourceCache, etc.) — do not use raw platform-specific APIs (fopen, std::ifstream, POSIX calls) out of laziness. The engine has cross-platform support for file I/O, logging, threading, and more. Check before reaching for platform APIs.
